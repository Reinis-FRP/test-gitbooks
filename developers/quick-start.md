description: 0 to 1 integration with the Optimistic Oracle V3.

# Quick start

The primary integration point into the UMA ecosystem is the Optimistic Oracle V3 (OOV3). The OOV3 is an _**oracle for arbitrary off-chain data**_ which leverages an interactive escalation game between _asserters_ and _disputers_ and is secured by _economic incentives_. It differs from the Optimistic Oracle V2 (getting started can be found [here](optimistic-oracle/getting-started.md)) by being easier to reason about and simpler in integration points.
